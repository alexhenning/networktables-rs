NetworkTables
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexhenning/networktables-rs.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/alexhenning/networktables-rs)

The beginnings of a Rust Network Tables implementation currently
there is a functional client for getting and setting booleans,
numbers and strings. Just about all other features are currently
lacking.
